## Rust Extra Ownership & Borrowing Samples

This repo contains some more samples for learning basic Rust Ownership and Borrowing stuff.

Follow allong each lesson in src/bin, reading the header comments in the file.

Not all code is running correctly, and this is intentional. What I wanted was to show some counter examples. Things that we must NOT do in order to write programs in Rust.

Have fun!
